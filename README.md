## Project overview
This application simulates temperature changes over time, updating every hour. It displays a line chart of the temperature data on the front-end. The data is generated by a Go server, and users can interact with it by refreshing the data with the "Refresh Data" button.

## Tech used
- Go (Golang): Backend server for generating time-series data.
- Chart.js: JavaScript library for creating the dynamic chart on the front-end.
- HTMX: Used for handling client-side interactions like fetching data without full page reloads.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the front-end.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the server - `go run main.go`
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Usage
On the homepage, you will see the current temperature chart with information about the start temperature, end temperature, delta, and current temperature.
Clicking the "Refresh Data" button will trigger a new set of time-series data and refresh the chart.
